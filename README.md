# C inmplemented Minishell (some UNIX basic functionalities)

This minishell was implemented in C at the end of 2020.
University project of Operating Systems subject.

Implement functionalities such as pipes, pointer handling, multi-threading and so on.

If you want to implement it yourself or just upgrade it, please let me know.

Hope that you enjoy it and it is useful to play around with C and some abstract stuff such as pipes and threading. ^^
